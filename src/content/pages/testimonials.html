            <p class="cs-review-p">
                When our shop window was smashed, I wasn’t sure who to call — but Safe & Secure 24/7 arrived quickly and had everything boarded up quickly. Jason was friendly, professional, and explained everything clearly. He even followed up the next day to arrange a proper glass replacement. Couldn’t have asked for better service.

                We’re proud to have helped so many people secure their homes and properties with fast, reliable service — whether it’s emergency glazing, door replacements, or window repairs. Here’s what a few of them had to say:

                <h3 class="cs-h3">Quick, Friendly & Efficient</h3>
                <p class="cs-item-text">
                    We had a break-in at our shop and needed the front door secured immediately. Jason showed up within an hour and sorted everything fast. Legend.

                <h3 class="cs-h3">Stress-Free Experience</h3>
                <p class="cs-item-text">
                    Called them on a Sunday when our living room window cracked. I was expecting a long wait but they arrived the same day. Super professional and didn’t overcharge either.

                <h3 class="cs-h3">Perfect Custom Fit</h3>
                <p class="cs-item-text">
                    We needed a custom-sized composite door for our old cottage, and these guys were brilliant from start to finish. They helped us pick the right style, colour, and fittings — and the final install was spot on. Neat job, no mess, and great communication throughout.

                <h3 class="cs-h3">Transformed the Front of Our House</h3>
                <p class="cs-item-text">
                    Jason replaced our tired front door with a design we chose. The quality is excellent, it feels solid and secure, and we’ve had so many compliments already. It’s made a real difference to the look of our home.
